Analyze whether any team members are overloaded with assigned issues in sprint 70722 by examining workload distribution across assignees, identifying those with excessive issue counts (13+ issues = overloaded, 9-12 = high load, 5-8 = normal), flagging anyone with multiple simultaneous "In Progress" items violating WIP limits, assessing priority mix and context-switching risks, and providing immediate redistribution recommendations with specific actions to prevent sprint failure and team burnout.
