I'll help you analyze sprint 70722 of the "RHDH F&UI plugins" team to check if it's been overcommitted by comparing committed vs completed story points.

Based on the analysis of sprint 70722 ("RHDH F&UI plugins 3277"), here's what I found:

## Sprint Commitment Analysis

**Sprint Status: OVERCOMMITTED** ⚠️

### Key Metrics:
- **Sprint Name**: RHDH F&UI plugins 3277
- **Sprint State**: Active (July 9 - July 29, 2025)
- **Completion Rate**: 55.6%

### Story Points vs Issue Count:
This team **does not use story points** for estimation. They track progress by **issue count** instead:

- **Total Committed Issues**: 45
- **Completed Issues**: 25 (55.6%)
- **In Progress Issues**: 14
- **Not Started Issues**: 6

### Assessment:
The sprint is **overcommitted** with a 55.6% completion rate. Here's why this indicates overcommitment:

1. **Remaining Work**: 20 issues still need to be completed (14 in progress + 6 not started)
2. **Risk Level**: Medium - the team is unlikely to complete all committed work
3. **Progress Trend**: With only ~55% completion rate partway through the sprint, it's unlikely they'll finish the remaining 45% of issues

### Recommendations:
1. **Reduce Scope**: Consider moving lower priority items to the next sprint
2. **Focus Effort**: Prioritize completing the 14 in-progress items before starting new work
3. **Identify Blockers**: Address any impediments preventing completion of current work

The team appears to have overcommitted by taking on too many issues for their capacity, as evidenced by the significant amount of remaining work with limited time left in the sprint.
